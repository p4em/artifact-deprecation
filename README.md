# Maven Enhancement Proposals

Unofficial enhancement proposals for Maven.

The official location for proposals is the [Apache wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=5964567).

To send proposals there you require:

- An Apache login, which is one of:
  - A full ASF Apache identity (+ signed ICLA or CCLA)
  - ASF Confluence + Jira logins associated with your personal email
- A permission grant to write in the Maven project's Confluence space.

Hence it may be easier to start a proposal off here.
